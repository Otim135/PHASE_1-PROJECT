# **Aviation Risk Analysis Project**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to analyze aviation incidents and assess the risks associated with different aircraft types, weather conditions, and flight phases. The analysis focuses on identifying low-risk aircraft, understanding incident trends over time, and evaluating the impact of external factors such as weather and aircraft characteristics. The data used in this project includes details on aviation incidents such as fatalities, serious injuries, and aircraft specifications.

The project follows the **Cross Industry Standard Procedure for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)** methodology to ensure a systematic and data-driven approach. The analysis includes univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using Python to uncover trends and patterns in the dataset. Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn are employed to create insightful graphs and heatmaps for easier interpretation of the data.

### **Key Objectives**:
- **Identify Low-Risk Aircraft Types**: Determine which aircraft models have the lowest incident rates and severity of accidents.
- **Analyze Incident Trends Over Time**: Examine how aviation incidents have changed over time and identify patterns.
- **Assess the Impact of Flight Phases**: Evaluate which flight phases (e.g., takeoff, landing) are associated with higher risks and incidents.
- **Investigate the Role of Weather Conditions**: Analyze how weather conditions impact the likelihood and severity of aviation incidents.


## **Python Version**
This project was developed using **Python 3.8**. All dependencies are managed using `pip` .

### **Key Libraries Used**:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **seaborn**: For advanced statistical visualizations.
- **numpy**: For numerical computations.
